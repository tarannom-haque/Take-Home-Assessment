/*Part 4 - Data Analysis*/
/* I would start off by Identifying items that are vegan and non-vegan. After reviewing the dataset,
we can identify the keywords or phrases that indicates whether the items are vegan or non-vegan. In the given dataset
there are terms such as "vegan", "plant-based" which are easily identifiable as vegan items. Items that are non-vegan will 
be some type of dairy products or animal products. 

Using these keywords, I would filter the items. Filtering will make the process easier by cutting 
the time of going line by line to identify these keywords. This will identify if the key words appear in each 
itemname or not and group them in different catagories.

Once this step is taken care of, I will go over each groups to review and validate manually
to ensure the accuracy of the results. 

Once the validation is cleared, any unnecassary columns or informatioan will need to be removed to have a clean dataset
to minimize the time Menu Health Core Team will spend in review.

Finally, I would doccument the steps I followed, any suggestions that I might have and any issues that I encountered during
this process. */
